             <div class="center" >
               Rt. Rev. Apostle (Dr.) Samuel Enoragbon Ogbonmwan JP, was born in 1930, to the great 
               Ogbonmwan-Oghodu dynasty. His father was Ogbonmwan Okunwague and his mother was
               Deaconess Ruemwinyogho Ogbonmwan, both of blessed memory. He was born at Emodu Village, 
               otherwise known as Ogunmwenyin Village, in Ovia North East L.G.A. of Edo State. He married his 
               heartthrob, Deaconess Grace Ogbonmwan (Nee Obasuyi) in 1965.<p>   They are blessed with five children.
               
               His upbringing in a polygamous setting pushed him into a difficult beginning like others of his time, but   
               his own situation was peculiar.         
                      
               He pleaded to be sent to school whereas, today, children are entreated to go to school. At that time, 
               by reason of the number of children and the lean resources available, only the eldest son (not daughter)
                of each wife was
                entitled to be sent to school. His own lot, therefore, was to be sent out as house-help.
                 Education was even not considered important for young Samuel.  </p>  
                
                 <button id="btnhider" style="text-align: center; font-weight:bold" class="  btn button_white scaling" id="bttonid" class onclick ="meed()"  >click to read more ..</button>
               <div id="hider" style="display:none">
                 <p>The use of the pejorative term "my servant" to describe young Samuel by the two uncles he stayed with,
                on two different occasions, made him to run away to his parents. Back home, he still insisted on going to school. 
                His parents yielded to his pleadings. He was sent to school at the advanced age of fourteen years.
               
               At school, he was brilliant. He had an accelerated promotion to standard II and a 
               double promotion to move to standard III. He was equally good in sporting activities; 
               he represented Ahmaddiya Primary School (now called Idah Prim. School) at "Empire Days", a colonial conception.
               </p>
               However, his quest and interest for education became short-lived. Between 1948 and 1949,
                he had lost his sight. Unable to see, without any means of livelihood, conscious of his parents' agony,
                 which was made worse by the despicable behaviour of the juju priests and traditional doctors contracted to heal him,
                  he collapsed into self pity. He felt society was unkind to him; he lost all hope. On three occasions, 
                  he attempted suicide. The survival instinct, that influenced his being sent away from home as house-help,
                   could now be appreciated. His situation had been made worse with the death, in 1958, of his elder brother.<br><br>
                             
               <div >
               <h3>HIS CONVERSION </h3>
               However, the Lord came to his rescue. He was converted to the Christian Faith in 1954. On ,. occasions,
                God opened his eyes but would close them back again-. The Lord said He wanted the Apostle to know 
                He had the power to restore his sight, but that if He did, Ogbonmwan would not serve Him, as a vessel 
                He had planned to use. This reminds us of the thorn that Satan (the enemy) planted in Apostle Paul's body, 
                in order to torment him and for which he sought God's solution. However, God told him that His grace was sufficient
                 for him. II Cor. 12:7-9.</div><br><br>
               
               <div><h3>ESTABLISHMENT OF CACGM</h3>
               He joined Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Ofunmwegbe Street, Oliha Quarters, Benin City, until God told him to move 
               away to found a different Mission. So, on 3rd January, 1974, he founded Christ Apostolic Church of God Mission, 
               over which he was the General Superintendent/Head of Mission, until his glorious Home-call on 3rd July, 2007. <br> 
               
               On 17th August 1970, he was ordained a Prophet. Five days after, he had his first son, Pastor Emmanuel Ogbonmwan.
                In 1980, he was ordained an Apostle.</div>
               
               EVANGELICAL THRUSTS
               He led crusade teams to all parts of Edo and Delta States (then known as Bendel) and many souls were converted 
               in the process. Between 1981 and December 2006, he went round Europe, Canada and the U.S. to plant churches and 
               to strengthen existing ones. Through his evangelical capacity, the gift of prayer and counselling, 
               he was able to win thousands of souls to the Lord. Through him, majority of Edo people are now converted and 
               have abandoned idol worshipping. There are presently more than 300 Branches of this Mission, 
               both within and outside Nigeria.<br><br>
                       
               
               <div><h2>AWARDS</h2>
               - On 9th Nov. 1991, he was awarded an Honorary Doctoral Degree in Practical Theology, by Oral Roberts University,
                U.S.A.
               - Edo State Government awarded him Justice of Peace (JP) on 12th Sept. 2001
               - In 1999, the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) gave him an award in appreciation of his Gospel work.
               - In 2000, the Merit Media Network of Nigeria honoured him with a Certificate of Merit,
               - In 2005, he was honoured by Vie Group as the best Edo Gospel Christian Singer in the Federation.
               - In 2006, the Christian Gospel Artistes Association of Nigeria honoured him with the Year's best Edo Gospel Music
                Producer, after making         him their Grand Patron. <br>
               - To crown it all, our Royal Father, the Oba of Benin, gave him an award of "Benin Achiever", in January 2007.</div>
               
               His life is a perfect marriage of the lives of great men of God. He was like Moses the leader and Intercessor,
                Paul the Preacher, David the Singer, Nehemiah the builder, Hezekiah the Reformer, Apollos the Orator, 
                Job the Faithful and perseverant, Peter the Rock and Samuel the Prophet. He was like the biblical Joseph, 
                through whose life story came into effect the truism that human spoiling cannot stop God's work (Gen. 50:20). 
                The scar inflicted on him metamorphosed into a star, to guide men to God. It is the Lord's doing.</div>
